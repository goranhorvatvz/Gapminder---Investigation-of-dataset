UDACITY - Data Analyst Nanodegree Program  
Project 2: Investigation of the dataset  
by Goran Horvat  

## Project Overview  

This exploration is made on the investigation of Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) by men.
Data have obtained through the Gapminder web site https://www.gapminder.org/data/. 
Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) by men is a dependent indicator, and other indicators that will be observed are GDP per capita, life expectancy, food intake measured by calories, body mass index by men, and SBP by a women.  
Observations of the indicators will be conducted:
* by years,  
* through countries and  
* world regions.  


## Choosing of Data Set
For this purpose datasets that are chosen are from Gapminder web site repository and they are:
* SBP by men
* SBP by women
* GDP per capita
* life expectancy 
* food intake
* body mass index by men

## Tools for Analysing the Data
Data are analyzed using Python in Jupyter Notebook and with use of libraries:
* Pandas 
* Numpy 
* Matplotlib

## Explorating Data Analasys
Answers on quastions about data are investigated trought single-variable (1d) and multiple-variable (2d) explorations.
The project includes relevant statistics and has visualizations of multiple comparisons and trends.  

## Conclusion
Creating a report of the analysis so that shares the findings that any limitations are clear.
